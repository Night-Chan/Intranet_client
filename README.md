lmao this is kinda meant for the students of switzerland who use like the intranet.tam.ch site to get to their schedule without having to log in every single time.
roadmap is just to add customization as well as lesson info to all the lessons when you click on them, plus advanced settings for loading the site faster

to use this you need to add your credentials to the txt file. Plain text unencrypted but who cares. After that just run the intra.py file and itll generate index.html for you, i uploaded it with my schedule cuz i couldnt be bothered to change it and itll do it anyway.
